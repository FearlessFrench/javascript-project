# JavaScript Project
### About
JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Its ability to run on both the client and server sides makes it a cornerstone of modern web development.

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects and exercises, demonstrating fundamental concepts and applications of the language. Each folder is named with a number and a brief description of the topic it covers.

### Getting Started
To run these projects, you can simply open the HTML files in your web browser. Most of the code will be contained within the HTML file itself or a linked JavaScript file.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. Navigate to a project folder, for example:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name/07_counter_program

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Running Projects Requiring a Local Server
Some projects, `like 75_fetch` and `76_weather_app`, may require a simple local server due to browser security restrictions. You can use a tool like `http-server` from npm:

1. Install http-server:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server

2. Navigate to the project folder and run the server:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name/76_weather_app
   http-server

3. Open the specified address in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
