# JavaScript
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

_Not to be confused with Java (programming language), Javanese script, or ECMAScript._

**JavaScript** (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/🔊ⓘ), often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
